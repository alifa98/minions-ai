# Minions AI 🤖📚

**An intelligent agentic AI system that helps developers navigate, understand, and work with documentation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

## 🚧 Project Status

> **⚠️ UNDER DEVELOPMENT** - This project is currently in early development phase. The features and capabilities described below represent our vision and roadmap, not current functionality.

**Current Status**: Early planning and architecture design  
**Expected MVP**: Q2 2024  
**Looking for**: Contributors, feedback, and early adopters

## Vision & Overview

Minions AI will be a specialized crew of AI agents designed to revolutionize how developers interact with documentation. When complete, the system will handle complex API references, SDK manuals, framework documentation, and technical specifications, with our intelligent agents acting as personal documentation assistants.

## Planned Features

### 🎯 **Developer-Focused Intelligence** *(In Development)*
Our agents will be specifically trained to understand developer workflows, technical terminology, and the context in which documentation is consumed. They won't just search—they'll comprehend, contextualize, and deliver precise answers.

### 🔍 **Advanced RAG Technology** *(Planned)*
Using state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Minions AI will:
- Index and semantically understand your documentation
- Retrieve relevant information with high precision
- Generate contextual, accurate responses
- Maintain source attribution for reliability

### 🚀 **Multi-Modal Documentation Support** *(Roadmap)*
- **API Documentation**: REST APIs, GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs
- **SDK Manuals**: Language-specific libraries and frameworks
- **Technical Guides**: Setup instructions, tutorials, best practices
- **Code Examples**: Inline documentation, README files, code comments
- **Architecture Docs**: System designs, data flows, integration guides

## Planned Key Features

### 🤝 **Intelligent Query Processing** *(Future Development)*
- Natural language questions about complex technical concepts
- Code-specific queries with syntax and usage examples
- Troubleshooting assistance with error resolution
- Best practice recommendations based on documentation

### 📖 **Context-Aware Responses** *(Future Development)*
- Understands your current project context
- Provides relevant examples and use cases
- Suggests related documentation sections
- Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions

### 🔗 **Source Integration** *(Future Development)*
- Direct links to original documentation
- Version-aware responses for different software releases
- Cross-reference capabilities between related documents
- Real-time updates when documentation changes

### ⚡ **Developer Workflow Integration** *(Future Development)*
- IDE plugin support for in-context help
- CLI tools for terminal-based queries
- API endpoints for custom integrations
- Webhook support for documentation updates

## Planned Use Cases

> **Note**: These are examples of what the system will be able to do once fully developed.

### For Individual Developers *(Future)*
- **Quick Reference**: "How do I authenticate with the Stripe API using Node.js?"
- **Troubleshooting**: "Why am I getting a 401 error with my OAuth implementation?"
- **Learning**: "Show me examples of React Hook patterns from the official docs"
- **Discovery**: "What are the new features in Python 3.12 that affect async programming?"

### For Development Teams *(Future)*
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand internal APIs and frameworks
- **Code Reviews**: Verify implementations against best practices from documentation
- **Architecture Decisions**: Compare different approaches documented across multiple sources
- **Migration Guides**: Navigate breaking changes and upgrade paths

### For Technical Writers *(Future)*
- **Content Validation**: Ensure documentation completeness and accuracy
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing or outdated documentation sections
- **User Experience**: Understand how developers actually use documentation
- **Content Optimization**: Improve discoverability and clarity based on query patterns

## How It Will Work *(Planned Architecture)*

1. **Document Ingestion**: Minions AI will process your documentation sources, creating semantic embeddings and knowledge graphs
2. **Query Understanding**: Natural language processing will interpret developer intent and technical context
3. **Intelligent Retrieval**: RAG technology will find the most relevant information across all indexed sources
4. **Response Generation**: AI agents will craft comprehensive, accurate answers with proper attribution
5. **Continuous Learning**: The system will improve based on user feedback and usage patterns
